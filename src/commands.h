// Usage messages
#define USAGE_MOVE "Move all joints to the provided angles (in degrees).\n \
\t - Joints will accelerate and move at a speed determined by their individual motor configurations.\n \
\t - Joints will not exceed their preset minimum / maximum limits.\n\n \
usage: move <angle1> <angle2> <angle3> <angle4> <angle5> <angle6>\n \
\t - angle [1-6] : The angle (in degrees) for each joint, relative to its home position. \n \
\n \
Example: \"move 180 -90 0 0 90 0\""

#define USAGE_JOG "Move the given joint, by a relative amount (in steps).\n \
\t - The joint will accelerate and move at a speed determined by it's motor configuration.\n \
\t - The joint will not exceed its preset minimum / maximum limits unless the -o parameter is specified.\n\n \
usage: jog <joint #> <steps> [-o]\n \
\t - joint # : The (zero-based) index of the joint to move (0 - 5).\n \
\t - steps : The number of steps to move. A positive number indicates clockwise movement. A negative number indicates conuterclockwise movement.\n \
\t - -o : (Optional) Override the preset limits (minimum / maximum) for this joint.\n \
\n \
Example : \"jog 3 -20 -o\" - Move joint #3 counterclockwise by 20 steps, ignoring the joint's min/max limits."

#define USAGE_LOG "Set the log level for the software. \n \
usage: log [TRACE | DEBUG | INFO | WARN | ERROR | FATAL]"

#define USAGE_SET "Set the extent (minimum, maximum or home position) of a given joint. \nThis command is guaranteed to NOT cause the robot to move.\n \
usage: set <extent> [<joint #>]\n \
\t - joint # : (Optional) The (zero-based) index of the joint to configure (0 - 5). If ommitted, all joints will be configured\n \
\t - extent : The extent to configure. One of:\n \
\t\t - min : The minimum angle of the joint.\n \
\t\t - max : The maximum angle of the joint.\n \
\t\t - home : The home position of the joint.\n\n \
Example : \"set 3 min\" - Set the minimum extent of joint #3 to its current position."
