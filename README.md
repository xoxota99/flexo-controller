# flexo-controller
Flexo is a 6DOF robot arm using stepper motors instead of (e.g.) servos. The "Big Brain" (Raspberry Pi) provides a web interface to higher-level functions. The "Small Brain" (Teensy 3.2) takes instructions from the "Big Brain" and executes them using stepper motors. The protocol and supported instruction set are in the /doc folder.
