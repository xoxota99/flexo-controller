# flexo-controller
Flexo is a 6DOF robot arm using stepper motors instead of (e.g.) servos. The client (Raspberry Pi) provides a web interface to higher-level functions. The controller (Teensy 3.2, this project) takes instructions from the client and executes them using stepper motors. The protocol and supported instruction can be found in the /doc folder.
